# Superformula Explorer

The code is hosted [here](https://ather-energy.github.io/superformula-blog/).

This is a visual implementation of the [Superformula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superformula).

You can explore our implementation of the superformula by either modifying individual parameters, or just by hitting the "random" button to see the shape created by a random combination of parameters.


Libraries used:

- [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)

- [THREE.js](http://threejs.org/)
